					iitg.yourdost.com&#39;s special group of supportive friends are here to offer their help when you need them. Some of our staff are unlicensed and unregistered lay people with a special interest and talent for being of help to you. Others are professional counsellors in training, while still others are already fully licensed. Overseeing all of these in case of the need for more advanced guidance and advice are top-level licensed professionals with a great deal of experience. For our people, this is not just a job. Everyone on our staff was selected because they have a sincere desire and personal need to be of help to others. Many have worked through difficult challenges themselves in the past and have developed knowledge and wisdom as a result that they wish to share with you.
