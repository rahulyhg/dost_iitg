		"details":"Rakesh Kakaty believes as every painting is a mark of an artist’s uniqueness, every therapist is also unique in the same way. He explores the often convoluted labyrinths of a client’s psyche, he seem to unravel a lot more about himself in the process.  <br/><br/>Throughout the years he has come to realize counseling is not about seeking glorious result or “breakthroughs” within a session, as counseling is not a way to solve the problems of a clients’ life. Counseling is empowerment and for empowerment, one needs an unconditional support. <br/><br/>He believes highest and the most charitable act in the world is to listen silently, attentively, when a weary heart is speaking.  <br/><br/>",
